  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
    My research interests center on brain development, plasticity, and the interaction between sleep, cognition, and neuropsychiatric vulnerability. I am particularly interested in how early-life biological and environmental factors shape neural circuits and behavior across development, combining animal models, human data, and electrophysiological methods.

  <h2>Creative Practice</h2>
  <p>
    Outside the lab, I’m fuelled by psychology books, dance floors, foreign languages, baking and coffee. 
    These moments make me see creativity and science as partners. 
    Because science isn’t separate from life but powered by the same energy, expression, 
    and curiosity that keep us human and evolving.
